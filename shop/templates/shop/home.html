         <p>The Chevrolet Camaro was always the bridesmaid to the Ford Mustang. Joining the ranks of American sports cars in 1967, three years after the Mustang, the Camaro was always playing catch up.

Matching the Mustang for looks and power the Camaro still trailed the blue oval's pony car in popularity. Ceasing production in 2002, the Camaro experienced a renaissance when it went back on sale in 2010 after a development program undertaken by Holden. Buoyed by the popularity of its starring role in The Transformers movies, it overtook the Mustang in the sales charts for a short while.

The current generation is powered by a 6.2-litre V8 that produces 339kW and 617Nm. Its aggressive muscle car looks make it easily recognisable, because what good is a sports car if people can't see or hear it.</p>

         The Chevrolet Corvette is the third member of the big American sports car trio. First released in 1953 the Corvette was a low-slung two door sports car available in convertible and coupe guises at various stages of its history.

It was the unofficial car of Nasa's astronauts throughout the golden era of man's expeditions to the moon, where each astronaut was supplied with a new car every year.

While never enjoying the level of sales success as the Ford Mustang or its Camaro sibling, the Corvette has still been a powerhouse in the sports car segment since its inception.

The current iteration is powered by the same 6.2-litre V8 found in the Camaro with power remaining at 339kW but with torque increasing to 624Nm.
